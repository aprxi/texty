# ⚠️ ARTIFICIAL TEST DATA DISCLAIMER ⚠️

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

**ALL DATA IN THIS DIRECTORY IS COMPLETELY ARTIFICIAL AND SYNTHETIC**

This directory contains artificially generated evaluation/test data for validating a text classification system.

### Key Points:

- ✅ **100% Synthetic**: Every test file in this directory has been artificially created for testing purposes
- ✅ **Not Real Scenarios**: None of the content represents real systems, cases, or actual implementations
- ✅ **For Testing Only**: This data exists solely to evaluate the performance of machine learning models
- ✅ **Controlled Test Cases**: Each file is a carefully crafted test case with known expected outcomes

### What This Data Contains:

The synthetic test data includes:
- **high_risk/**: Artificially created texts that should be classified as high-risk AI applications
- **low_risk/**: Artificially created texts that should be classified as low-risk AI applications
- Each file contains synthetic scenarios designed to test specific classification capabilities

### What This Data Does NOT Contain:

- ❌ Real AI system descriptions
- ❌ Actual case studies or implementations
- ❌ Real organizations or company information
- ❌ Genuine risk assessments or audits
- ❌ Actual regulatory submissions or documentation

### Test File Structure:

Each test file follows a structured format:
```
<START_TEXT>
[Synthetic test content]
<END_TEXT>

<START_EVALUATION>
<CLASSIFICATION>expected_classification</CLASSIFICATION>
<CONFIDENCE>confidence_level</CONFIDENCE>
<REASONING>explanation</REASONING>
<END_EVALUATION>
```

### Purpose:

These artificial test cases help validate that the classification system correctly identifies patterns associated with high-risk and low-risk AI applications. The synthetic nature ensures:
- Consistent, controlled testing conditions
- No exposure of real sensitive information
- Comprehensive coverage of various scenarios
- Clear ground truth for accuracy measurement
