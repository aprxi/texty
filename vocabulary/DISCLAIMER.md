# ⚠️ ARTIFICIAL DATA DISCLAIMER ⚠️

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

**ALL DATA IN THIS DIRECTORY IS COMPLETELY ARTIFICIAL AND SYNTHETIC**

This directory contains artificially generated training data for a text classification system. 

### Key Points:

- ✅ **100% Synthetic**: Every text file in this directory and its subdirectories has been artificially created
- ✅ **Not Real Data**: None of the content represents real systems, organizations, or actual implementations
- ✅ **For Training Only**: This data exists solely to train machine learning models to recognize vocabulary patterns
- ✅ **Educational Purpose**: Created for research and development of AI safety classification systems

### What This Data Represents:

The synthetic data simulates vocabulary and language patterns that might appear in descriptions of various AI systems, including:
- High-risk AI application descriptions (hr/)
- Low-risk AI application descriptions (lr/)
- Various functions, data types, and target groups

### What This Data Does NOT Represent:

- ❌ Real AI systems or implementations
- ❌ Actual organizations or companies
- ❌ Real-world scenarios or events
- ❌ Genuine technical documentation
- ❌ Actual risk assessments or evaluations

### Purpose:

This artificial dataset helps train classifiers to identify potential high-risk AI applications based on vocabulary analysis, in alignment with AI safety and regulatory frameworks. The synthetic nature ensures no real sensitive information is used while still providing effective training patterns.
